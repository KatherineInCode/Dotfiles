# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles and other configuration scripts for setting up a development environment, particularly around the command line. Right now, I work almost exclusively on macOS, so these are geared entirely in that direction.

This repository, as dotfiles repositories are apt to be, under constant construction.
